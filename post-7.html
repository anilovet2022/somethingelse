<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernando de Magallanes stopped in what is now Patagonia in 1520 on his way around the world, when he saw a giant on the beach. Giants in Patagonia is a well-documented example.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magellan sent one of his men to establish contact with him (the emissary's reply would have to be witnessed, but unfortunately it has been lost to history), so that they may exchange dances and songs and show their friendship. (In Patagonia, Giants)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was successful. The guy was successful in transporting the behemoth to a little island off the shore, where the great captain awaited. During the day, Antonio Pigafetta, a scholar, documented the sight in his travel notebook, which subsequently became Magellan's Journey: the First Trip Around the World.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"When he saw us, he was amazed and terrified, and he raised his finger in the idea that we were from heaven." He was so tall that even the tallest among us couldn't reach his waist, and he spoke with a deep, powerful voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patagonia was previously populated by giants who dwarfed the heavenly Europeans who came to conquer them, as shown in the image above.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe it wasn't the best test. However, it's possible that the Tehuelches, who discovered Magellan, were genuinely large, and that this narrative has some truth in reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magellan let his men feed and drink the monster on that little island, then made the error of displaying him a mirror.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The monster was scared when he saw himself," Pigafetta recounted, "and leaped back, throwing four of our soldiers to the ground."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, once the situation had settled down, the explorers made contact with the rest of the tribe, hunted alongside them, and even constructed a hut to store their supplies while remaining on the shore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magellan had a plan after spending several weeks with the tribe: he would capture two of them and transport them to Spain to test the giants he had seen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"However, this must be done with care; else, the giants would have gotten our troops into difficulty." Magellan handed them a variety of metal items to occupy their time, such as mirrors, scissors, and bells, in the hopes that they would not mind being bound and chained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"With which these giants were delighted to see these chains, although not understanding where they should be placed." However, throughout the lengthy trip back to Spain, Magellan misplaced his proof. The giants were destroyed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was that narrative that Magellan and Pigafetta brought back, as well as the new name for the land of the giants, Patagonia, whose origin is still a mystery. Because of the word "leg," some claim that it means "Land of the Big Feet."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Primaleón was the name given to a race of wild people known as the Patagonians by Magellan, who most likely stole the name from a popular novel at the time. (In Patagonia, Giants)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the British throwing cold water on the whole idea, Sir Francis Drake managed to contact the same Patagonians, according to his nephew in The World Encompassed, published in 1628:</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://theancientzen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3-Fernando-de-Magallanes-unexplained-experience-with-3-meter-tall-Giants-in-Patagonia-400x574.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-3873"/></figure></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magellan was not completely deceived by the names given to these giants; in general, they differ in stature, greatness, and body strength, as well as the ugliness of their voices; however, they were not as monstrous and giant as they were depicted; there are some Englishmen as tall as the tallest we could see, but the Spaniards do not believe that any Englishmen would come here to reprove them, so they are more willing to lie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was an open sore for academics, and properly so. The Tehuelches were merely a village of sculpted people, according to William C. Sturtevant's article Patagonian Giants and Baroness Hyde of Neuville's Iroquois Drawings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While following missions by Magellan measured Patagonia to be up to 3 meters high, some put it closer to 1.82 meters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"When scientific reports began to surface, popular interest in the giants of Patagonia faded," says Sturtevant. "Some nineteenth-century estimations or individual measurements remain high," higher than 2 meters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, better measurements of the Tehuelche men revealed that they stood roughly 1.80 meters tall, which is entirely acceptable for a human but completely unacceptable for a giant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"However, if we adopt the lowest (and least recorded) of these mediums based on current male measures," he continues, "the Tehuelches are among the tallest known people globally."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Male Europeans throughout the sixteenth to eighteenth century, such as Magellan, would have measured in the 1.5 meter range. His imagination, on the other hand, appears to have outgrown his little height.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But why was there such a disparity in stature between Europeans and these "end-of-the-world" natives? Animals, including humans, develop faster in colder regions and slower in hotter climes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bergmann's rule states that a big body loses less heat and is hence more adapted to surviving temperatures below zero.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result, it's no surprise that the world's greatest terrestrial carnivores, such as the polar bear, reside in the extreme north, whereas tropical species, which lose heat more quickly, adapt better to the smothering jungles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Environments may impose the same strain on humans over evolutionary time. As a result, residents of glacial Patagonia should have developed faster than their European counterparts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Skeptics believe that gigantism is likely the source of many of the accounts of giants in the Americas in a feeble attempt to explain things without actually examining the topic, but they have never given evidence to support this claim.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gigantism is exceedingly uncommon, so uncommon that no occurrence numbers exist for this hormonal disorder. Only about 100 occurrences of gigantism have been documented in the United States' history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In truth, the vast majority of tall individuals nowadays – those who reach or approach 2 meters – are free of giant disorder. On the other hand, just 0.000007 percent of modern humans grow to be 2 meters tall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So how can you explain why the Smithsonian has 17 skeletons over 2 meters tall discovered in ancient burial mounds in a very limited region of North America by chance?</p>
