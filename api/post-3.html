 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archaeologists have uncovered a "Lost Golden City" buried beneath the ancient Egyptian city of Luxor for the last 3,000 years, according to the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (April 8).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city of "The Rise of Aten" was built by Tutankhamun's grandfather, Amenhotep III (ruled 1391-1353 B.C.). People used the "Golden City" during Amenhotep III's co-regency with his son, Amenhotep IV (who later changed his name to Akhenaten), as well as during Tut's reign and the pharaoh who followed him, adored as Ay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the city's long history, archaeologists were unable to find its ruins until recently. According to historical accounts, it formerly housed King Amenhotep III's three royal palaces and served as Luxor's most important administrative and industrial hub.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Many foreign delegations hunted for this city and never located it," said Zahi Hawass, the archaeologist who oversaw the Golden City excavation and former minister of state for antiquities affairs, in a translated comment.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the year 2020, his crew started out on a mission to find King Tut's tomb shrine. According to Hawass, they chose this location because "both Horemheb and Ay temples were located in this region."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They were taken aback when they discovered mud bricks everywhere they dug. The team rapidly realized they had stumbled into a large, well-kept metropolis. "Houses fill the streets," Hawass observed, observing that some had 10-foot-high walls (3 meters). Rooms in these mansions were decorated with knickknacks and instruments widely used by ancient Egyptians.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The discovery of this ancient city is the second most important archeological find after the tomb of Tutankhamun" in 1922, according to Betsy Brian, an Egyptology professor at John Hopkins University. "Not only will the discovery of the Lost City give us with a unique look into the lives of ancient Egyptians during the empire's pinnacle, but it will also help us solve one of history's most perplexing mysteries: why did Akhenaten and Nefertiti chose Amarna?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Golden City was defeated within a few years after Akhenaten took power in the early 1350s B.C., and Egypt's capital was transferred to Amarna.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as they realized they had found the Lost City, the team began wooing it. They accomplished this by searching for objects bearing Amenhotep III's cartouche seal, an oval filled with hieroglyphics spelling out his name. The cartouche was discovered on wine jars, rings, scarabs, colorful pottery, and mud bricks, indicating that the city was active during the reign of Amenhotep III, the ninth pharaoh of the 18th dynasty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After seven months of investigation, the researchers uncovered a number of neighborhoods. The group discovered the remains of a bakery near the city's south end, which had a food processing and cooking facility with ovens and ceramic storage containers. According to the statement, the kitchen served a large clientele due to its size.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://theancientzen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-In-Egypt-a-3000-year-old-Ancient-Golden-City-was-recently-discovered.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3612"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In another, still largely guarded portion of the site, archaeologists uncovered an administrative and residential zone with bigger, neatly-arranged apartments. The region was surrounded by a zigzag fence, a popular architectural style towards the end of the 18th Dynasty, with just one entrance point linking to the residential parts and internal passages. The single gateway, according to the declaration, acted as a security measure, allowing ancient Egyptians to control who entered and exited the metropolis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archaeologists discovered a mud-brick manufacturing factory in another area, which was used to construct temples and annexes. On these tiles, the researchers discovered seals with King Amenhotep III's cartouche.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A plethora of casting molds for amulets and decorative artifacts were also uncovered, indicating a busy temple and tomb decoration manufacturing line in the region.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Across the region, archaeologists unearthed items associated with industrial operations like as spinning and weaving. Metal and glass-making slag were also discovered, although the workshop where these products were created has yet to be identified.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several tombs have been uncovered, including two uncommon cow or bull burials and a one-of-a-kind human burial with outstretched arms to the side and a rope tied around the knees. Scholars are currently looking into these graves to find out more about what happened to them and what they represent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The crew just discovered a jar holding around 22 pounds (10 kilograms) of dried or cooked beef. The butcher luwy prepared dressed meat from the slaughterhouse of the stockyard of Kha for the third Heb Sed holiday in the year 37, according to the inscription on this jar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the scholars, "this vital evidence not only supplies us with the names of two people who lived and worked in the capital, but it also proves that the city was functioning throughout King Amenhotep III's co-regency with his son Akhenaten." A mud seal with the words "gm pa Aton," which translates as "the kingdom of the sparkling Aten," the name of a temple founded by King Akhenaten at Karnak, was also discovered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to historical sources, the capital was relocated to Amarna one year after this pot was built. Akhenaten, who was famed for compelling his people to worship just one deity, Aten, the sun god, commanded this. Egyptologists also dispute on whether he transferred the capital or abandoned the Golden City at the time. It is also uncertain if the city was repopulated when King Tut returned to Thebes and reestablished it as a religious center, according to the statement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More studies might reveal more about the city's stormy history. And there's a lot more ground to cover. "We will announce that the city goes all the way to Deir el-Medina," Hawass said, alluding to an ancient worker's hamlet where the artisans and artists who built the royal tombs in the Valleys of the Kings and Queens lived.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, archaeologists uncovered a large cemetery to the north that has yet to be thoroughly studied. So far, the team has discovered a series of rock-cut tombs that can only be reached through rock-cut steps, a feature shared by the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Nobles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archaeologists want to excavate these tombs in the coming months to learn more about the individuals who lived there and the objects they discovered.</p>
