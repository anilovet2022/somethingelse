        <h1 class="title-us">An Ex-Navy Officer Exposes the truth about Antarctica</h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone is aware that Antarctica is the world’s most mysterious continent. And the continent’s mystery deepens when we find that the FAA has established a No-Fly Zone in its center. However, before we continue down the rabbit hole any further, we need take a close look at the Piri Reis Map.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Piri Reis map portrays the today’s ice-free Antarctic continent as a verdant continent. Around 500 years ago, a Russian expedition commanded by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev unearthed this one-of-a-kind chart.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While escorting a party of explorers and scientists on the cold continent, a navy officer recalls his escapades. He also witnessed a medical emergency in Antarctica. When the naval officer was forced to travel the Antarctic ice due to a medical emergency, he noticed a massive ice crack.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said that the whole team of researchers he accompanied to Antarctica vanished abruptly for two weeks, during which no one could locate them. When they returned from wherever they had gone, they were outraged by what had occurred and were instructed not to speak about it by high officials.</p>

<p>In 2012, a satellite photographed an odd oval object in Antarctica.</p>

<p>This weird structure is on the ice, and early examination has revealed that it is either a natural phenomena or a man-made construction.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this is not a one-off occurrence. Numerous fascinating constructions, unusual artifacts, and even huge pyramids have been discovered in Antarctica over time. The image below depicts an unidentified object that collided with a hill in Antarctica. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One thing is certain: Antarctica has always been and will continue to be a mystery area not accessible to the general public.</p>

<p>There are ideas that an old subterranean society exists, and that certain gateways in Antarctica offer access to this realm.</p>
